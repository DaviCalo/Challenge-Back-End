ForumHub API - RESTful Backend for a Forum Platform
Welcome to the ForumHub API project! This is a backend system designed to manage topics within a forum platform, similar to what you might find on educational platforms like Alura. Our goal is to create a RESTful API that allows users to perform CRUD operations on topics, ensuring proper data handling, validation, and security.

Project Overview
The ForumHub API focuses specifically on managing forum topics. Users will be able to:

Create a new topic
View all existing topics
View a specific topic
Update a topic
Delete a topic
This implementation follows best REST practices and includes data validation according to business rules. It also integrates a relational database for data persistence and includes authentication and authorization services to restrict access where necessary.

Current Status
This project is currently in development. We are actively working on implementing the features, setting up the database, and ensuring everything functions smoothly. You can track the progress using our Trello board, which is organized into columns such as "To Do," "In Development," "Paused," and "Done."

Technologies Used
Spring Framework (Spring Boot)
REST API principles
Relational Database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
Authentication/Authorization mechanisms
